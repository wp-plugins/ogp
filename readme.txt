Add Open Graph Protocol tags to your blog. Control how your posts and pages are presented on Facebook. Change the object type of your site or pages.

== Description ==

Automagically adds Open Graph Protocol tags to your blog. Control how your posts and pages are presented on Facebook and other social media sites.

No manual configuration necessary, but some cool things can be changed...

= Object types =

When someone likes a page on Facebook, it will be displayed in their profile's "Info" section. This section is divided into categories, e.g. "Movies", "Actors", "Sports Teams", with each category listing the pages of that object type which the user likes.

So if your site is about your softball team's activities or about the cool motion picture you just produced, Open Graph Pro lets you change the object type *of your entire site* so your Facebook page will show up under the right category on your fans' profiles.

Likewise if you're a band and you have multiple songs and albums, and you have a single page per song/album, you can change the object type of your song or album pages. If you have one page per member of your band, you can change the object types of those pages to "Musician" so your drummer's fans can show special support for the sweating fella in the back. ;)

Or if you're a company with one page per product or service you can change the object type of all your product pages.

Or if you're an author and you have one page for every book you've published... you get the idea.

= Images =

When someone likes or shares your blog on Facebook, your header image is shown. If someone likes or shares a post, the featured image (post thumbnail) is shown. If you haven't selected a featured image, then the plugin looks for the first image inside the post. If there aren't any images in your post, then your blog's header image is shown.

No worries: If you would like to use a special image for Facebook, instead of your header image, Open Graph Pro lets you specify the URL.

= Admin users on Facebook =

Facebook allows page admins to post updates to the news feeds of their fans. Needless to say: you can specify a list of Facebook users (using [numerical user IDs](http://ten-fingers-and-a-brain.com/wordpress-plugins/ogp/facebook-id/)) who are allowed to post updates.

Now combine this with the possibilities opened up through the use of different object types: E.g. if you're a band and you have a separate page for each member of the band, you can allow the keyboarder to post updates to his fans, but not to those of the bass player.

= Further reading =

The plugin's homepage can be found here: http://ten-fingers-and-a-brain.com/wordpress-plugins/ogp/ – Show your support by going there to "Like" it!

Check out the [API Documentation](http://ten-fingers-and-a-brain.com/wordpress-plugins/ogp/api/) to see how you can use the data generated by Open Graph Pro to build "Like" buttons directly into your theme.

For more information on the Open Graph protocol go to: http://ogp.me/

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `ogp` folder to the `wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Done (No configuration needed, but you can tune things in the 'Settings' section of the admin area or on the post and page editing screens)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does this plugin not include a "Like" button? =

The contents of the Open Graph protocol meta tags are usually independent of the layout of the site, whereas the format of the "Like" button is not. It can be tall with the big counter, or smaller with the smaller counter on the right, or even come without a counter. It can include the "Send" button, show faces, etc.

So I figured that the "Like" button should best be placed in your (custom) theme, where it can be styled according to your individual layout, whereas the meta tags should be generated by this plugin, and they will "survive" any theme/layout change.

When building the actual buttons you may need access to some of the data generated by this plugin. Check out the [API Documentation](http://ten-fingers-and-a-brain.com/wordpress-plugins/ogp/api/)!

I know that this is a very 'puristic' approach, but here's to everyone who uses standard themes: I have also written a plugin for social media buttons, including the Facebook "Like" and "Send" buttons, but also Twitter's "Tweet" button, a "Flattr" button, and Google "+1". It doesn't have a fancy name just yet, but can be downloaded from the wordpress.org Plugin Directory: [wp-like](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-like/)

= Why is there no way to do XYZ? =

Initially all of my plugins are written for my own personal use or because I need them in a client project. That sets the list of features. Feel free to visit [the Open Graph Pro page on my site](http://ten-fingers-and-a-brain.com/wordpress-plugins/ogp/) and to leave a comment! I've added new features to other plugins based on community feedback before, and if I like your idea I might do it again.
